# Calculate Quarterly Averages

[https://calculate-avgs.web.app/](https://calculate-avgs.web.app/)

The primary goal of this application is to accurately compute three distinct averages within the specified range of high and low values, effectively segmenting the range into quarters. This division enhances the precision of the analysis.

Serving as a robust tool for technical analysis in both cryptocurrency and stock trading markets, this application generates critical numbers that demarcate essential support and resistance levels. These levels are instrumental in strategizing order placements, thereby optimizing trading decisions.

Typically, market charts exhibit a patterned movement, which this application leverages by calculating quarterly averages. These averages are not only crucial for delineating current monthly levels but also play a pivotal role in forecasting the directional trend—whether upward or downward—of prices at the close of the current month and the onset of the subsequent one.
